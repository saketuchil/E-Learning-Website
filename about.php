                <font color="black">
                    First of all, you are required to produce a sample write-up of 2-3 pages to show your writing capabilities and command over the chosen subject.

                If you qualify based on the provided sample write-up, we will move on with the following steps:

                    <li><p>We will work with you to prepare a Table of Content (ToC) for the subject on which you are going to write a tutorial.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Based on the finalized ToC, you as the author will give us a proposal indicating the delivery plan and the total cost of the tutorial, taking into account the time and effort required to produce the final draft.</p></li>
                    <li><p>We will then have a discussion with you and finalize the cost of the tutorial along with its tentative delivery plan. </p></li>
                    <li><p>Thereafter you start developing the tutorial and submit your draft for a technical and presentation review.</p></li>
                    <li><p>We will provide necessary comments and feedback which you will incorporate and submit the final draft of the tutorial. </p></li>
                    <li><p>Once you deliver the final output with the desired quality, we will release your payment either through bank-to-bank transaction or through Paypal.</p></li>
                    <li><p>There is also an arrangement to divide the whole payment in different installments based on content delivery milestones.</p></li>
